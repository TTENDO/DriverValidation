#SMART PARKING SYSTEM
Our main goal is to achieve a system that eases finding parking for drivers at their finger tips.

###Motivation
Through our interaction with a sample Of Uagndan drivers, they hustle with finding where to park

###Development tools
Built with node js, pug and mongoDb


###Screenshots of how this iteration flows
